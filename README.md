<h1>Calculator Application for Android</h1>


<h2Description:</h2> 
The Calculator application is a simple yet powerful tool designed to perform basic arithmetic operations on Android devices. Developed using Android Studio with Java, this app provides a user-friendly interface and reliable performance for performing calculations.

<h2Features:</h2>
<h3>Basic Arithmetic Operations:</h3>

Addition (+): Add two or more numbers.
Subtraction (-): Subtract one number from another.
Multiplication (*): Multiply two or more numbers.
Division (/): Divide one number by another.

<h2>User Interface:</h2>

Display Screen: Shows the current calculation or result.
Numeric Keypad: Includes digits 0 through 9.
Operator Buttons: Buttons for arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).
Additional Buttons: Includes C for clearing the current input, = for computing the result, and . for decimal input.
Layout: The interface is designed with a grid layout for easy access to all buttons.

<h2>Input Handling:</h2>

The app processes input in a straightforward manner, handling numeric and operator inputs efficiently.
User input is validated to ensure correct operations, including handling division by zero.

<h2>Calculation Logic:</h2>

Utilizes basic arithmetic logic to perform calculations.
Implemented using Java's built-in ScriptEngine for evaluating expressions, or a custom parser for more control and better performance.

<h2>Error Handling:</h2>

Displays appropriate error messages for invalid operations or inputs.
Handles edge cases like division by zero or incomplete expressions gracefully.

<h2>Technical Details:</h2>

Programming Language: Java
Development Environment: Android Studio
UI Framework: XML layout files for designing the interface, combined with Java code for logic.
Libraries/Dependencies: Utilizes Android SDK components and possibly third-party libraries for advanced functionality.

<h2>Implementation Details:</h2>

<h3>UI Design:</h3>

The layout is created using XML in the res/layout directory.
Button click events are handled in Java code by setting up OnClickListener for each button.

<h4>Java Logic:</h4>

MainActivity.java: Contains the main logic for handling button clicks and performing calculations.

Calculator Logic: The core calculation is managed by methods in the MainActivity class, which process the input and display the result.

<h2>Testing:</h2>

Thoroughly tested on various devices to ensure compatibility and performance.
Unit tests and UI tests are included to verify the correctness of the calculator's functionality.
